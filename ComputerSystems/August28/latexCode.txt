\section{Economic Stabilization Act}
In March 2006, Congress raised the debt ceiling by an additional \$0.79 trillion to \$8.97 trillion, which was approximately 68\% of GDP. As of October 4, 2008, the \textit{Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008} raised the current debt ceiling to \$11.3 trillion.

\section{Mathematical Expressions}
The equations from the research paper \textit{The Loss Surfaces of Multilayer Networks} are as follows:

Equation (2):
\begin{equation}
h_k^v \leftarrow \sigma\left(W \cdot \text{MEAN}\left(\{h_{k-1}^v\} \cup \{h_{k-1}^u, \forall u \in N(v)\}\right)\right)
\label{eq:equation2}
\end{equation}


Equation (3):
\begin{equation}
\text{AGGREGATEpool}_k = \max\left(\{\sigma(W_{\text{pool}}h_k^{ui} + b), \forall ui \in N(v)\}\right)
\label{eq:equation3}
\end{equation}


Equation \ref{eq:equation2} represents the mean aggregator used in the GraphSAGE algorithm. It applies a non-linear activation function $\sigma$ to the weighted mean of a node's previous layer representation $h_{k-1}^v$ and its neighbors' representations $h_{k-1}^u$. This method aggregates neighborhood information to update the nodeâ€™s representation, akin to localized spectral convolution, but without performing concatenation operations.

Equation \ref{eq:equation3} describes the pooling aggregator in the GraphSAGE algorithm. Each neighbor's representation is transformed using a neural network and aggregated via element-wise max-pooling. This method captures diverse features from the neighborhood set using a non-linear activation $\sigma$ and can utilize various symmetric functions like mean-pooling.

As described by Ying et al. \cite{gcn_recommender}, graph convolutional networks are suitable for large-scale recommender systems. Similarly, the work of Leskovec and Faloutsos \cite{sampling_large_graphs} addresses efficient sampling techniques from large graphs.
